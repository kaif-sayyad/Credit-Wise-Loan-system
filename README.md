# 🏦 CreditWise Loan Approval System

## 📌 Overview
The **CreditWise Loan Approval System** is a Machine Learning–based project that predicts whether a loan application should be **Approved** or **Rejected**.  
It helps financial institutions make **fast, accurate, and unbiased** loan approval decisions using historical data.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
SecureTrust Bank is a mid-sized financial company offering personal and home loans across urban and rural regions of India.  
Currently, loan applications are evaluated manually by loan officers, which causes:

- Rejection of eligible customers (loss of business)
- Approval of high-risk customers (financial loss)
- Time-consuming and biased decision-making

To overcome these issues, the bank wants an **intelligent loan approval system powered by Machine Learning**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This project uses **Machine Learning algorithms** trained on historical loan application data to:
- Analyze applicant details automatically
- Learn hidden patterns from past records
- Predict loan approval decisions before final human verification

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- Supervised Learning
- Binary Classification (Approved / Rejected)
- Data-driven decision making

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
Each record in the dataset represents a **loan applicant** with attributes such as:
- Personal details
- Income information
- Employment status
- Credit history
- Loan status (target variable)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
